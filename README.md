## Business Background
**Context :**  
The company is one of the big provider of telecommunication services and have a lot of customer. The company have services include: phone service, TV streaming, internet and internet security and make profit from customer who paid their services monthly. Churn is a measurement of the percentage of accounts that cancel or choose not to renew their subscriptions. A high churn rate can negatively impact Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and can also indicate dissatisfaction with a product or service. The source of this dataset is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn">Kaggle</a>.  

**Problem Statement :**  
The company wants to know how much loss is caused by churn and want to prevent customer churn but we don't know which customer will leaving and we dont know why. If we know which customer will churn, we can give a voucher to keep customer or we will allocate the money to improve the services who make customer churns. the company wants to know how much loss is caused by churn.

**Goals :**  
To find how much loss caused by churn and predict which customer will churn and find out the reason so company can do action which give the company profit.

**Metric Evaluation :**    
Determine the suitable metric to rate the performance from the model
